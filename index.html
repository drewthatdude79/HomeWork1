            <p>Born and raised Floridian, grew up in Gainesville where my brother, sister and I went to a very small
                private school, and I later was homeschooled. My first look at coding was at my dad's store. I created a
                line of text and learned how to "run" the text to copy over and over all the way down the screen. I
                later became a massage therapist in 2005 and worked for different chiropractors for about 7 years and
                decided to make a change in career to better my future. I got married to most wonderful woman, my
                bestfriend and biggest cheerleader, very supportive!</p>
