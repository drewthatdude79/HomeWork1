                    <p>Born and raised Floridian, grew up in Gainesville where my brother, sister and I went to a very
                        small
                        private school, and I later was homeschooled. My first look at coding was at my dad's store. I
                        created a
                        line of text and learned how to "run" the text to copy over and over all the way down the
                        screen. I
                        later became a massage therapist in 2005 and worked for different chiropractors for about 7
                        years
                        and
                        decided to make a change in career to better my future. I got married to most wonderful woman,
                        my
                        bestfriend and biggest cheerleader, very supportive!</p>
